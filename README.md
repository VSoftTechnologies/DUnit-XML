DUnit-XML
=========

XML Reporter for DUnit which outputs NUnit compatible XML

Should conform to the Results.xsd found at <http://www.nunit.org/docs/2.6.4/files> which is identical to the one under <http://www.nunit.org/docs/2.6.3/files>.

NOTE : This project is no longer maintained or supported. We recommend you switch to [DUnitX](https://github.com/VSoftTechnologies/DUnitX) which has first class support for NUnit xml format.
